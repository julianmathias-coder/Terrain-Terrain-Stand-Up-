# Break_Timer
**IoT project to encourage movement**


## This Project:

* Uses NFC to disable an alarm 

* Uses colored lights, fan, salt lamp indicate alarm state 

* Can only be disabled after the timer begins a countdown and an NFC device is scanned 

* The project is useful because it physically requires an NFC scan and consequently, movement to the NFC reader

* You can get started with this project by finding the required materials and schematics at: [Link](https://www.hackster.io/julianmathias) 

* The revision history is available in the GitHub repository 

* Julian Mathias and members of the CNM Enginuity program contributed to this project and help maintain it
